cannot access nerdctl exposed port in bridge mode
=================================================
ref: https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl/issues/2133

# steps to check the problem:
1 config allow incoming traffic to exposed port
  $ iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport ${exposed_port} -j ACCEPT  

2 check the availability of ip:port, but the curl output is fine:
  $ curl -v ${ip}:${port}
  * Trying xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:9080...
  * Connected to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) port 9080 (#0)
  > GET /gui/ HTTP/1.1
  > Host: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:9080
  > User-Agent: curl/7.74.0
  > Accept: */*
  > 
  * Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
  < HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
  < Connection: close
  < Content-Length: 0
  < Content-Type: text/html
  < WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="uTorrent"
  < Cache-Control: no-cache
  < 
  * Closing connection 0

3 check nat table rules in ip:port numerical format (nat table is responsible for port mappping)
  $ sudo iptables -L -n -t nat
  Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
  target             prot opt source               destination         
  DOCKER             all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            ADDRTYPE match dst-type LOCAL   # docker config
  CNI-HOSTPORT-DNAT  all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            ADDRTYPE match dst-type LOCAL   # nerdctl config 
  ...

4 analysis:
  the output of nat iptable shows that: 
  due to installation of rule of docker/nerdctl, conflict occurs on rules for PREROUTING
  a machine with both nerdctl & docker installed might lead to chain rules conflict, which make the port unaccessible
