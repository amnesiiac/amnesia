hostfw code in action
---------------------
# using tcpdump for pkts analysis, report:
  checksum 0x2a37 incorrect, shuld be 0xaf9a(may be caused by "TCP checksum offload"?)

  this might due to some program secretly modify the package, which lead to checksum mismatch
  and checksum offload is enabled, so the package is dropped.

# some code fix, just disable all checksum offload of the transmission path:
  $ hg diff -c 20523
